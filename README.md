Uses Firebase as a backend to support user account creation and login.

The game itself is designed to assist in practicing typing. You are presented with a randomly generated word and have to type it. If you make a mistake, your typing resets and you need to start again on the same word. If you complete the word correctly you are presented with a new word. There is also a button allowing you to refresh the word.

I plan on implementing user high scores and keeping track of mistakes as well as streaks and Average Words Per Minute so users can seem improvement in their phone typing speed.
